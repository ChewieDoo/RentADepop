# **Overview**

Depop is a popular e-commerce platform that allows users to buy and sell used, vintage, and repurposed clothing.  Reaching over 42 million users in 2023 mainly consisting of Millennials and Gen Zs, Depop aims to digitalize the experience of thrifting and reduce waste in the fashion industry. 

## Brief

### **Objective**

Depop wants to further its sustainability agenda by building a cloth-rental feature onto its platform.  

The management believes there is massive untapped potential in the cloth rental market and aims to **integrate the cloth rental experience onto its existing digital platform.**

### **Approach**

I took the **Double-Diamond Design Thinking** approach to first discover user needs and concerns during the rental process.  Then, I constructed a problem definition which I continuously refined as I developed the user-interface (UI) and received user feedbacks.  Finally, I prototyped the  optimized UI and its relevant flow.

### **Solution**

I successfully designed the UI to highlight the rental feature and seamlessly integrated it into Depop’s existing platform.  Through feedbacks and co-creation session with stakeholders, I developed a platform that delivers a smooth renting experience which simultaneously addresses the user challenges as well as business considerations.  

The design solution is broken down into 2 segments.  First, I focused on **introducing the rental option at various stages of the user-journey** without disrupting Depop’s user-flow by utilizing existing features to facilitate the integration including: colored item tags, floating check-out banners, item sorting page.  Second, I explored the idea of **building rapport and community** between buyers and sellers through customized shop-fronts, peer-to-peer communications, and review features.
